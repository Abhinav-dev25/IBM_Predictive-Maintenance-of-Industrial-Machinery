# IBM_Predictive-Maintenance-of-Industrial-Machinery

## Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning

Predictive Maintenance is a machine learning project designed to anticipate machinery failures before they occur, enabling proactive interventions, reducing unplanned downtime, and optimizing maintenance schedules. This solution uses real-time sensor data to classify different types of machine failures such as tool wear, heat dissipation issues, and power failure.

## ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- âœ… Accuracy > 99.5% on multi-class failure classification
- ðŸ“Š Real-time sensor data analysis (temperature, torque, speed, etc.)
- ðŸ”„ Automated maintenance scheduling (scope)
- ðŸ“¦ Scalable cloud deployment ready (IBM Cloud / IKS)
- ðŸ§  Handles class imbalance effectively using preprocessing techniques

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a **multi-class classification model** that can predict the type of machine failure from real-time sensor inputs, thereby enabling:

- Early detection of issues
- Automated maintenance alerts
- Reduced downtime and repair costs

---

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach

### ðŸ”Ž Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values (if any)
- Normalization of continuous sensor values
- Label encoding of categorical columns (e.g., `type`, `failure_type`)
- Dealing with class imbalance using:
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
  - Class weights in model training

### ðŸ“ˆ Model(s) Used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost
- Deep Learning models (LSTM / CNN) â€“ for advanced time-series modeling *(future scope)*

### ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score (per class)
- Confusion Matrix
